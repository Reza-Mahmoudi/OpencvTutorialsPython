# OpencvTutorialsPython

Basic
1. How to Read Image-Video-Webcam  --------------------> Learn how to read images videos and webcam.
2.5 Must Know OpenCV Basic Functions ------------------>5 Must know opencv functions for beginners. Gray Scale, Blur, Edge Detection, Dialation and Erosion.
3.How to Crop and Resize Images -----------------------> How to crop and resize and iamge. Resize could be used to scale up or scale down an image where cropping can be used to get a part of the image.
4.How to Draw Shapes and Text --------------------------->Learn to create blank images along with how to draw Lines, rectangles, circles and custom text.

5.Joining Multiple Images to Display-------------------> Join multiple images together as one image for easy visualization of the workflow. Learn how to do it for smaller noumber of images and how it could be scaled up to have several iamges in the same image.

6.Warp Prespective/BirdView ------------->Learn how to creat a warp prespective of a selected area of an image using fixed points.
7.Detecting Clicks on Images ----------------> How to detect clicks on images and how to use these points to create a warp prespective.


Intermidiate
Real Time Color Detection (Webcam) ----------->In this project we will learn how to detect any color in an image using the HSV space with the help of opencv Trackbars. We will also stack the images together to make the workflow smoother.

Real Time Shape Detection using Contours ->In this project we will learn how to detect shapes of objects by finding their contours. Contours are basically outline that bound the shape or form of an object. So we will be detecting multiple shapes and how many corners points each shape has along with its area .

Tracking Objects ----> In this project we are going to learn object tracking. We will use our mouse to select an object and track it using different methods that opencv has to offer. This is a fairly simple tutorial so it should be easy to follow.

Custom Obejct Detection using HaarCascade ->Object Detection using the Haar cascade. We will learn how to run pre-trained models and how to collect data for custom Objects. Later we will train using this data and create an Xml file for deploying

QRcode and BarCode Detection -> Learn how to detect QRCode and BarCode in an image using OpenCV

Text Detection OCR ->Learn how to detect Text in images and use it in openCV
